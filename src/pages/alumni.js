Such success stories are the testament of our intentions whenever we work so passionately to impart tech skills in each young person that walks through our doors. Whether as short as the 1 Week training or as long as a full year in the Innovation and Technology program, we strive to ensure that NairoBits leaves an indelible mark in the lives of these young people.</p>
                                <p>We consider our alumni as our partners and as a rich resource for the success of our programming. Time and time again, we have hired from our alumni pool, had alumni encourage students as guest speakers and even worked with alumni to sponsor trainees throughout the course.</p>

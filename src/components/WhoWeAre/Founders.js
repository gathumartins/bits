But because of their enthusiasm and creativity it developed into a permanent school. There is something about NairoBits that works. That survives every storm and changes with the tides. The success of NairoBits and the new Bits schools that came after is truly a group effort. I am proud to be part of that group, that has provided a great learning environment for so many youths. A lot of what I do today I have learnt at NairoBits!‚Äù</p>
